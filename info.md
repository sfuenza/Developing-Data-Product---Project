## Information about the amount of Arrests in USA by States in year 1973

The Shiny application use the information of the dataset "USArrests", that contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.  

This is the result of the project for the "Developing Data Products" course of the Data Science Specialization from the Johns Hopkins University.  

You can select the States you want to include in the graphics in the Left side Panel, and you have 2 kinds of graphics:  
* Map Graphics: That shows the amount of murder, assault and rapes arrests in each USA States by clicking the selected button  
* Bar Graphics: Allows you to compare the amount of arrest in each category by:  
      * North vs South states  
      * West vs Central vs East states  
      * States by region (NorthEast, SouthEast, NorthCentral...)  
      * All states separate  

You can check the source code in the gitHub repository [HERE](https://github.com/sfuenza/Developing-Data-Product---Project)

IF you want to know better how to use the application you can see the Slidify Presentation [HERE](http://rpubs.com/sfuenza/Developing_Data_Products_Slidify)
